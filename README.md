# InstegramBot
Basic project I did to learn how to work with Python and Selenium libarary.
Pyhton based Instegram bot for managing accounts on Instegram.

This is not a fully function bot, just some basic function for basic operations.
The functions I implement:
*Login (when given a spesific user name and password)

*search other users (by user name, or scroll in a spesifc HashTag)

*follow other users

*Like other users posts
